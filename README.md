Sprint-2
========
A Maven built spring MVC web application built by Team 9; Codings are fun. 

How to run?
1.Download the files, import project via Eclipse, 
2.Run the project as Maven Build
3.Under Run Configuration, in the Goals box, use jetty:run.

This is just a protoype, not much validation and signing up works only per session. Functions wise: Able to add new teaching sessions, students able to sign up for sessions and able to change the views of the repeat Frequency. Have fun playing around with this web application!
