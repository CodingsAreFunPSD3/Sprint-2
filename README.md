Sprint-2
========
A Maven built spring MVC web application. Download the files, import project via Eclipse, and run the project as Maven Build, and under Run Configuration, in the Goals box, use jetty:run.

This is just a protoype, not much validation and signing up works only per session. Functions wise: Able to add new teaching sessions, students able to sign up for sessions and able to change the views of the repeat Frequency. Have fun playing around with this web application!
